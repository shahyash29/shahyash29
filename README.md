## Professional Summary

I am a passionate Software Developer with over 5 years of professional experience in full-stack development, specializing in building scalable web applications and healthcare technology solutions. Recently completed my Master's in Computer Science from California State University Los Angeles with a 3.93 GPA. While my core expertise lies in software engineering with technologies like React.js, Node.js, Python, and Java, I am enthusiastic about expanding into AI/ML engineering and cloud computing architecture. I have hands-on experience with machine learning frameworks through academic projects and personal initiatives, and I'm eager to apply these skills in a professional setting. My passion for continuous learning drives me to explore cutting-edge technologies in artificial intelligence, deep learning, and cloud-native architectures to solve complex real-world problems.

**Currently seeking opportunities to transition into AI/ML Engineering and Cloud Computing roles.**
