## Professional Summary

I am a passionate Software Developer with over 5 years of professional experience in full-stack development, specializing in building scalable web applications and healthcare technology solutions. Recently completed my Master's in Computer Science from California State University Los Angeles with a 3.93 GPA. While my core expertise lies in software engineering with technologies like React.js, Node.js, Python, and Java, I am enthusiastic about expanding into AI/ML engineering and cloud computing architecture. I have hands-on experience with machine learning frameworks through academic projects and personal initiatives, and I'm eager to apply these skills in a professional setting. My passion for continuous learning drives me to explore cutting-edge technologies in artificial intelligence, deep learning, and cloud-native architectures to solve complex real-world problems.

**Currently seeking opportunities to transition into AI/ML Engineering and Cloud Computing roles.**

## Professional Experience

### üíº Software Developer | HealthCare Startup
**December 2024 - Present**

In my current role at a healthcare startup, I have been instrumental in building secure backend infrastructure using NestJS and IPFS with Merkle-proof hashing to ensure tamper-proof healthcare data transfers. I've conducted comprehensive performance testing by simulating high-load scenarios with 1K‚Äì2K files using JMeter and CloudWatch to validate system reliability under production conditions. Additionally, I've implemented automated regression testing using Python and Selenium, scheduling these tests to run every 48 hours to maintain system stability and catch potential issues early in the development cycle.

### üéì Graduate Research Assistant | California State University Los Angeles
**October 2024 - May 2025**

During my graduate research assistantship, I developed a Java-based Azure Function to efficiently ingest over 50K HERE traffic records into Cosmos DB, achieving an 80% reduction in manual work processes. I worked extensively with deep learning models, fine-tuning them using TensorFlow and Keras to improve traffic prediction accuracy for smart city applications. My research also involved prototyping real-time transformer-based pipelines for multimodal data processing, exploring scalable solutions for processing complex urban data streams from various sources.

### üñ•Ô∏è UI Developer (Software Engineer) | Media.net
**August 2019 - August 2023**

At Media.net, I focused on engineering responsive email templates using React.js, achieving an impressive 85% cross-client rendering accuracy across various email platforms and devices. I spearheaded the development of an internal Email Builder Tool that revolutionized our template creation process by introducing drag-and-drop functionality, which automated 60% of template creation tasks and significantly reduced development time. I also enhanced our deployment reliability by implementing robust CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and GitHub Actions, ensuring smoother and more reliable software releases. Throughout my tenure, I mentored 2 junior developers, conducted thorough code reviews, and collaborated closely with cross-functional teams to ensure on-time project delivery while maintaining high code quality standards.
